							<li>
								<p>Developer is not liable to you for any damage or alteration to your equipment including, but not limited to, computer equipment, handheld device, or mobile telephones, as a result of the installation or use of the Application. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Information contained in the Application is not legal advice pertaining to specific cases or specific legal matters. You are urged to consult an attorney-at-law of your choice directly if you have a legal question or feel that you require clarification regarding the legal effect of any information contained in the Application. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Engaging in a sexual act without the other person's consent may be considered sexual assault, rape or other criminal activity (depending on the relevant jurisdiction), and may also expose you to civil liability. In this regard, the purpose of the Application is to provide You, the User, with accessible evidence in the event of criminal prosecution or civil dispute regarding consent for sexual relationship with another person. As a result, you are hereby reminded that, generally, consent is a voluntary, sober (a person who is intoxicated, be it through alcohol, legal or illegal drugs or other chemicals, cannot legally give consent), conscious, wanted, informed, mutual, honest, and verbal agreement. Consent cannot be granted if distracted. As an active agreement, consent cannot be coerced, and coercion should never be used in an attempt to obtain consent. Consent is never implied and cannot be assumed, even in the context of a relationship and even when prior consent has been obtained. Consent can ALWAYS be withdrawn, by words or actions or otherwise, by either party – prior to OR while actually engaging in sexual relations. Whenever another party withdraws consent, before or after providing consent (via this Application or in some other manner), before or during sexual activity, "No means NO." Furthermore, only of-age individuals are capable of granting consent. The minimum age when a person is able to legally consent to sexual relations with another person is referred to as the "age of consent" and this age varies from state-to-state, so be sure to check the laws of your jurisdiction if you have concerns in this regard. Laws may also vary according to the gender of the actors, the type of sexual acts, and also issues regarding abusing a position of trust. In the United States, sexual relations with a minor is considered a criminal offence with charges ranging from misdemeanor to felony statutory rape, and may also expose you to civil penalties. Since the age of consent prevents a minor from consenting, obtaining consent cannot be used as defense for sexual relations with a minor. In addition, you acknowledge that tampering with any data collected by the Application may constitute tampering with evidence. With the foregoing in mind, you are hereby advised to consult with a qualified attorney in the state or jurisdiction in which You are using, or planning on using, the Application regarding the effectiveness of the Application as an evidentiary tool (i.e., the extent to which the consent obtained through the application may be admitted into evidence, the facts and circumstances leading to the consent and the facts and circumstances associated with the sexual relations) and the admissibility of the same in the event of a criminal prosecution or dispute. The Developer's intention is to prevent wrongful accusation and not for the Application to be used in furtherance of criminal or tortious activity. </p>
